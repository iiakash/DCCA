# Deep Convolutional Clustering Autoencoder

## The reopository contains deep convolutional clustering autoencoer method implementation with PyTorch

## Overview

The application of technologies like Internet of Things(IoT) have paved the way to solve complex industrial problems with the help of large amounts of information. Industrial systems are now intertwined with each other constantly sharing data among them. Vast quantities of this data is unlabeled, and it is a mammoth task to label the data manually. If there are anomalies present in the data it is even harder to find and label the anomalous samples. The objective of unsupervised anomaly detection solves this problem by partitioning the input data into distinct normal and anomalous regions. In this project, an unsupervised anomaly detection approach by jointly using a Convolutional Autoencoder, and  the K-means clustering algorithm is implemented. The encoder part of the autoencoder is used to map a low dimensional feature representation of the original data. The decoder is responsible for reconstructing the encoded data to the original form. The convolutional autoencoder is optimized using the error produced from the reconstructed data. A clustering algorithm (i.e., K-Means) is simultaneously being applied on the latent feature representation to initialize two cluster centers. This allows us to jointly optimize the network by combining an additional clustering loss. The clustering loss enforces the encoder to learn clustering friendly representation by minimizing the mean-squared error between the cluster centers and the data samples.

## Data

The data used for this project is provided by BÃ¼ltmann GmbH. The dataset contains high frequency sensor data from a metal peeling machine. Due to the sensitive nature of the data used in this project, the data is not provided in this repository. The data is considered exclusive for this project and can not be used for any other purpose.
